# Responsive Web Page Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is a fully responsive and accessible web page built **from scratch** using only **HTML** and **CSS** — no JavaScript or external CSS frameworks were used.

The main objective was to replicate a given designer layout while demonstrating mastery in semantic HTML, accessibility, and responsive design techniques.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure, accessibility  
- **CSS3**: Flexbox, media queries, transitions  
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach  
- **Accessibility**: ARIA roles, color contrast, keyboard navigation support  

---

## ✅ Features

- 🎨 **Pixel-perfect UI**: Matches the provided design file  
- 📱 **Responsive Layout**: Adjusts automatically to smaller screen sizes (mobile version activates at **480px** or less)  
- 🧭 **Accessible**: Built with semantic HTML and accessibility best practices  
- 🔗 **Interactive Links**: Link states change to `#FF6565` on `:hover` and `:active`  
- 🖱️ **Interactive Buttons**: Buttons reduce `opacity` to `0.9` on `:hover` and `:active`  
- 📐 **Content Width Constraint**: Maximum content width is **1000px**, centered in the viewport  
- 🚫 **No JavaScript** or external CSS libraries like Bootstrap

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

| Device Width | Layout Version  |
|--------------|-----------------|
| > 480px      | Desktop / Tablet|
| ≤ 480px      | Mobile version  |

The mobile version adjusts layout elements for small screen usability, such as stacked blocks, readable font sizes, and mobile-friendly navigation.
